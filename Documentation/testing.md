# Test plan

After I have made my website I will firstly, I will go through the website to try and find any faults/issues, after that I'll have my website reviewed by two people and I will then find solutions for all of the improvments that I have recieved or given myself. I will also provide explanation on why I am making these improvements and also reasons for if I agree or disagree with any feedback I recieve from my reviews.

# Evaluation 

After testing my website and seeing how it functions, meets the stakeholders requirements and how appealing it seems I have given my personal opinions on what I believe is the great about the website and what I think I should improve.

Personally, I believe my website meets a majority amount of the stakeholders requirements and their needs. The website is perfectly functional, obviously apart from the purchase page but I did leave a little notification that lets any user know that this hasn't been implemented yet and will be eventually. Apart from that everything else functions completely fine e.g. navigation system, hyperlinks, videos, carousel. I also believe the color scheme is great and will be appealing to stakeholders because it doesn't contain too many colors and not too little, plus it also similary matches the logo of my website that I made on adobe photoshop. I believe the fonts will be fairly readable for people and is rather appealing. I also believe that the images included in the website are at an appropriate size so that they don't come out as compressed and look distorted, plus I have made sure to showcase the most recent phones the most so that they attract more users to go through my website.

# Improvements (my opinion)

Despite how I believe that the website meets nearly all of the stakeholders requirements, I do still think that there are some improvements that I can make in the future, most likely in version two of the website or some I could just quickly change.

## Improvements 
- shop nav bar compresses with web page
- carousel images darken (hoverover effect)
- include more content on help page

## 1st improvement 

What I mean by the shop nav bar compressing with the web page is that currently it doesn't move the way I would expect when the web page is compressed making it go out of position slightly. This is also the same case for the nav bar on the help page because it is the same design. However, this isn't the case for the main nav bar at the top of each web page, when the page compresses the main nav bar will just look like the mobile version where there are two buttons on each side.

## 2nd Improvement 

This can easily be changed but the images that are included on the carousel can be darkened when the cursor hovers over them. This is just a way of identifying which content is being hovered over by the user and which one will be clicked on if the user clicked on the mouse. To do this will just add this hover over effect onto the css for the carousel. 

## 3rd Improvement 

I honestly, do believe that some images of the phones in the shop web page are a bit different in terms of the size of the phones on the images. I would be better to keep the consistency of the sizes because users need a good view of the products. I can change this by editing the images on photoshop.

# Changes made

These are the changes that I have made to the website, some of these reasons are because of the reviews I did or becuase of my own opinion of thinking it makes the website look much better.

## Content added

These are the contents that I have added whilst developing my website but was not mentioned in my planning of the website. 
 
### I added:
- Youtube video
- Discord hyperlink
- Banner background image
- Phones database
- Different nav bar font

# Reasons I added them

## Youtube video

Firstly, I added a youtube video which is a showcase of the iphone 13 because it will allow users to get a great overview of the most recent item that was added to the shop web page, the video is found under the newest items on the home page.

## Discord Link

Secondly, the discord hyperlink is included in the text on the help pages to navigate any user that clicks on it to the discord log in page, it pretty much functions like a contact us button, this is so that any user can ask the developers of this website to provide information on a certain issue they had, an actual discord server hasn't been made for this website.

## Banner background

Thirdly, I did end up using an image for the background of my banner at the top of each page, I chose this image because it seems very appealing due to its brightness and it stands out from all of the other colors included on my website which is great because it is the first thing that will appear on screen when any web page renders in.

## Database

After that, I added a database at the bottom of each shop web page apart for the main shop web page, it includes all of the costs and names of the phones, the dates they were released into stores and the company they were released by and the founder of that company.

## Nav bar font

The nav bar font was changed after Ashleys review, I did completely agree that the current font I was using made the text bit harder to read since when the cursor hovers over it the color will change and it doesn't mix well with the font, so I just changed it to the font 'inter sans-serif' which is much easier to read as seen in the image for the banner background and the discord link.

## Content removed 

These are the contents that I ended up removing which were mentioned in my planning of the website. 

### I removed:
- Swapped footer contents with copyright information
- Contact us page
- Reviews page

## Reasons I removed them

Firstly, I swapped the original contents of the footer (website information, read review button and contact us button) with copyright information, this is because the reviews page would be unnecessary because the website is completely new so it can be added in a future update, the contact us button isn't necessary either becuase I now have a discord link in the help pages. This also means the contact us page and reviews page won't be included in the about us and help pages because they are completely unecessary to have right now.

## Mobile version

Like the PC version I do believe the mobile version works fine and it is structured appropriately to fit onto a mobile phones screen. It also highlights that I acknowledged the fact that some people may not own a PC to access the other version of the website so I made a mobile version which increases the amount of people that can access this website by a huge amount.

# Evaluation 

Personally, I believe my website meets a majority amount of the stakeholders requirements and their needs. The website is perfectly functional, obviously apart from the purchase page but I did leave a little notification that lets any user know that this hasn't been implimented yet and will be eventually. Apart from that everything else functions completely fine e.g. navigation system, hyperlinks, videos, carousel. I also believe the color scheme is great and will be appealing to stakeholders because it doesn't contain too many colors and not too little, plus it also similary matches the logo of my website that I made on adobe photoshop. I believe the fonts will be fairly readable for people and has a very stylish font. I also believe that the images included in the website are at an appropriate size so that they don't come out as compressed and look distorted.

# Improvements (my opinion)

Despite how I believe that the website meets nearly all of the stakeholders requirements, I do still think that there are some improvements that I can make in the future, most likely in version two of the website or some I could just quickly change.

## Improvements 
- shop nav bar compresses with web page
- carousel images darken (hoverover effect)
- include more content on help page

## 1st improvement 

What I mean by the shop nav bar compressing with the web page is that currently it doesn't move the way I would expect when the web page is compressed making it go out of position slightly. This is also the same case for the nav bar on the help page because it is the same design. However, this isn't the case for the main nav bar at the top of each web page, when the page compresses the main nav bar will just look like the mobile version where there are two buttons on each side.

## 2nd Improvement 

This can easily be changed but the images that are included on the carousel can be darkened when the cursor hovers over them. This is just a way of identifying which content is being hovered over by the user and which one will be clicked on if the user clicked on the mouse. To do this will just add this hover over effect onto the css for the carousel.

# Stakeholders

Stakeholders - are a group of people that take an interest to how an enterprise can meet their needs. There are many aspects to a website that stakeholders aspect to be in it e.g. quick loading, good performance, navigation etc. In this case my website is an online phone shop so I would have to include the following; reasonable prices, phone images, product explanation and phone brands.

# Stakeholders elaboration

## Target audience
Since the website will be an online phone shop, it must mostly include the latest and definately the most reliable since most of the users that would view this website are teenagers and young adults which are the age groups that use phones the most. Having the most popular phones included in the website will also indicate that my website is reliable to provide phones that are wanted by a large amount of people.

## Product info:
The customers need to know what they are spending their money on, so the product info would include things like the product name, how well it performs, its uses and maybe ratings and reviews so that customers know if it is worth buying based on other peoples opinions.

## Reasonable  costs
Obviously, the cost of a product can't be too high otherwise no stakeholder is going to bother purchasing it. Also, the price shouldn't be too low either because not only are you not gaining much but it could also be an indication to the customers that it may not perform well. 

## Navigation
One of the key aspects of a website is to have easy navigation because stakeholders never want a complicated navigation system. Ideally, I would place any hyperlinks for the main web pages at the top of the page underneath the banner so that it is easily accessible, it will be the same for every web page in the website. 

## Layout
Since this is an online shop that is aimed at adults, customers would expect this to look professional and also to not have a complex design. I must try not to include aspects that would be on specific websites like sort that are aimed at children because their layout is used to help them navigate through the website e.g. large buttons, very colourful colour scheme etc. Adults don't need as much assisstance when navigating through websites so i should keep my website much more neat, organised and more professional. 

# All requirements:
- Fast render (3 seconds or less)
- Simple navigation (4 options on nav bar)
- All web pages have same colour scheme (4 colours or less)

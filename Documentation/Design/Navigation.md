## Summary

These are all of the web pages that are only accessible after opening the shop web page, so the table and diagram won't include the web pages in the nav bar. After opening the shop web page there are four optional web pages, each of the four web pages contain different phone brands e.g. Samsung, Apple, Google, Oppo.
There is one more web page that can be opened only if a user is on any of the phone brand web pages, this is not accessible on the shop web page and that is the purchase page so that a user can look at further deatils for the product they want to buy such as colour, rating or costs etc.

## Summary

When a user opens the 'about us' web page there will be two other web pages that they can open and those are 'reviews' and the 'Who are we?' web pages. There are no more web pages after the 'reviews' web page and the only option is to go back to the 'about us' web page. However, in the 'Who are we?' web page there is another web page that can be opened called 'our intentions', whilst on that web page there is one more web page that can be opened which is called 'History'. To get back to the 'about us' web page the user will have to go ack through the three web pages since the 'our intentions' and 'History' web pages aren't connected to the 'about us' web page.

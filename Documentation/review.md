# First review

On the 14th of March 2022 I had my website reviewed by Ashley Oliver and he gave me some feedback and provided me some improvements to make on my website to make it visually more appealing.

# Nav bar improvments

## 1st improvment

The first improvement that was provided to me was that he adviced that I should "either change the font for the nav bar or resize it" this is so that it stands out more and is easier to read. I personally agree that this should be changed and I will probably just change the font mainly because it is more easier to do so since changing the size can possibly have more of an effect once changed because the text is contained within a box with very limited size itself.

## 2nd improvement

Secondly, he explained that the "hovertext is hard to read" and I should change the color of it. This issue was related to the fact that the font I was currently using didn't mix well with having a darkblue hovertext color. Obviously the solution to this is to just change the hovertext color but I will do it with css mainly because it would be more simple than doing it on javascript and requires less code.

# Carousel improvements 

## 1st Improvement

Firstly, for the carousel, Ashley mentioned that "the first image is a bit distorted". This was because of the size of that image and it had been compressed into the carousel making it look more distorted. To improve upon this I will just go into adobe photoshop to resize the image to an appropriate size where it won't look dsitorted when it is placed into the carousel.
 
## 2nd improvement

The second improvement that I recieved for the carousel was to "make the buttons more visible". This applied to certain images on the carousel, especially the ones with white backgrounds. Because the buttons have similar colouring to the backgrounds of certain images it mkaes them hardly visible and the only way they would be noticed is if the cursor hovers them or if the image changes to another without a white background. I highly agree that this should be changed, so what I will do is add black borders on the left and right side of each image with a white background on adobe photoshop. 

## 3rd improvement 

The third point that was given was to "make the images clickable". This is because the image being a button/hyperlink would be a larger component to click on instead of having a small text at the bottom of the carousel being the hyperlink. Also the fact that some people may have difficulties in clicking small hyperlinks was acknowleged so it would be better to have something as large as an image to be clickable. I agree that this should be changed and I will resolve this by taking the hyperlink off the text and then just link each image to the web page in my website that it represents, I will also make the cursor point when it hovers over the image to indicate to any user that the images are clickable.

# Shop web page improvement

Another very simple improvement that Ashley provided me with was for the main shop web page and that wads to "bring the content further up". He explained why he recommended this and it was because commonly people tend to scroll through websites quickly and they might miss the content that is further down the page, so it was ideal to bring it up further so that it is visible when a user loads up this web page. I agreed to change this so what I will do is just reduce the padding between the nav bar and the content below it on my css file. 

# Youtube hyperlink improvement

Lastly, Ashley recommended that instead of a youtube link I should "embed video code" so that the actual youtube video will appear on my website so that any user can just watch it, it also saves time having to load up youtube to watch the video. I agreed with this statement so what I will do is load up youtube and copy the link when I get onto the web page with the video and then just include embed in the youtube link so that it renders onto the web page.

# Second review

On the 19th of April 2022, I had my website reviwed by Levente Albert, he provided me with some feedback and he agreed that my website was great and functioned properly, he only gave me one improvement which I completley agree with.

## Improvement 

The improvement Levente provided me with was to change the size of certain images of the phones within the phone shop web page. His reason was because "some of them are larger than others, try and keep them the same size". I completely agree with this statement because it will keep the consistency and seem more professional if I do so. I can change this with the use of adobe photoshop, I can just take the larger images onto there and then resize which can be done for a future update.
